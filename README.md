Analysis of the most efficient machine learning model to analyze credit card fraud. 

Process:

1) Acess Kaggle API to access real credit card transactions with Kaggle API. 

2) Perform under sampling and narrowing of variable's standard deviation to improve logical model predictions of imbalanced data-sets

3) Tested 5 different models: Logistic Regression, Sequential Neural Network, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier and Linear SVC.
   
4) Selected the model that showed the showed the highest precision, accuracy and f-1 score: The Sequential Neural Network.
